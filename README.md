This repository implements standard Neural Network architectures using TensorFlow.
These architectures are implemented as `scikit-learn`-compatible models.
To code these models, I was inspired by the great 
[`aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples`](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples) GitHub repository: 
do not hesitate to visit it if you aim at building your own neural network models using Tensor Flow.  

# Requirements

```bash
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
```

# Available models

None

# Models we plan to integrate

* Autoencoders
* Stacked autoencoders
* MLP (with the option to initialize using a pre-trained Stacked AE)
